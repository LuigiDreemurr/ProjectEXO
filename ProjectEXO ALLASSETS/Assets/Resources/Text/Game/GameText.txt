So, uh, we're just going to run you through some generic tests to examine the suits capabilities.  Nothing too hard?
Ok then, someone activated all the hazards.  WHO ACTIVATED ALL THE HAZARDS!!!!!!

For your next test, step into that totally not deadly purple ray of light.
I'll admit, I activated the traps. I can't exactly let you leave. Ya money grabbin slime ball!

Whether you walk through lasers and saws or not, one way or another you're gunna fry!

Hehehe, this is going to be a really RAD test!
Congratulations you green freak, you can get past radiation now...

SIKE!
Oh crap, I didn't see that coming...

You know if you never accepted that job, all of us scientists could have left happier and wealthier today. But no. I had to press the extermination just because of you. Boo. You Suck.
I'll admit, I didn't think that's how boxes worked.

I'll give you $10 if you turn back right now.
Alright! Alright! I'll give you $100 if you if you agree to live here.
Okay. Fine. I'll give you $1000 if you jump into the suicide pit

You've got past my saws and my lasers and my fire and my radiation and even my doors... Now fight this mad French guy. (Argument about French Guy) Oh... well no matter. Try this on for size!
